    'Located in the beautiful hills of eastern Nepal, Devi Kiwi Farm is a shining example of what dedication, family support, and sustainable farming can achieve. Established in 2072 B.S., the farm is led by Mr. Devi Pokhrel, a passionate and experienced farmer, along with his supportive wife, Mrs. Tila Pokhrel. Their farm has become a model for organic fruit cultivation and rural entrepreneurship in the Tehrathum District.',
    'üå± Meet the Founders: Mr. Devi Pokhrel & Mrs. Tila Pokhrel',
    'With over 10 years of experience in kiwi farming, Mr. Devi Pokhrel is not just a farmer but also a leader in the agricultural community. As the Chairman of the Tehrathum District Kiwi Organization, he has trained over 100 farmers each year, helping them begin their own kiwi farming journey.',
    'His wife, Tila Pokhrel, has been by his side since day one ‚Äî working both in the kiwi and tea farms. Her contributions are not limited to agriculture; she also served as the First Deputy Mayor of Laligurans Municipality (2074‚Äì2079 B.S.) from the Nepali Congress Party, leading with dedication and vision.',
    'üçá Organic Kiwi Farming',
    'Devi Kiwi Farm spreads across 5,214 square meters (‡•ß‡•¶ ‡§∞‡•ã‡§™‡§®‡•Ä ‡•™ ‡§Ü‡§®‡§æ) of rich, fertile land located in Solma, Purundin ‚Äì Ward No. 9, Laligurans Municipality, Tehrathum District.',
    'With nearly 250 kiwi plants, the farm produces an impressive 5,000 to 7,000 kilograms of organic kiwi fruit annually, earning a profit of nearly NPR 7‚Äì8 lakh per year. All their produce is grown using organic fertilizers and natural pesticides made from their own cows, goats, and hens ‚Äî ensuring high quality and sustainability.',
    'üå± Tea Farming & Expansion into Kiwi Products',
    'In addition to kiwis, the Pokhrel family also engages in organic tea farming, producing 500 to 700 kilograms of tea leaves annually. Both Devi and Tila are equally involved in the tea farming process, working together with dedication and harmony.',
    'Their farm has also started processing kiwi into juice and pickles, and they are now planning to introduce kiwi jam and wine production within a year ‚Äî expanding their reach into value-added organic products.',
    '‚öôÔ∏è A Multifaceted Life',
    'Despite his busy schedule on the farm, Mr. Devi Pokhrel also runs an electrical shop in Lasune Bazar, some distance from his home. He balances his business and farming life with impressive commitment and energy. His wife Tila continues to inspire local women with her involvement in both governance and agriculture.',
    'As Devi Kiwi Farm continues to grow, their plans for kiwi-based products, sustainable agriculture, and empowering others shine brightly as a model for rural Nepal.'
